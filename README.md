# Shuriken

This project was created on JavaScript (Three.js).

You can view its work on *[link](https://isaywtf.github.io/shuriken/)*, but on github it has visible bugs.

## logo

Logo *shuriken* was done using SVG.

## canvas

The left part of the first screen of the project was drawn using the canvas by coordinates in JS.

For this, various algorithms for scaling, centering, resetting coordinates were created.

This is necessary so that in the future you can load any coordinates of the drawing, after which they automatically adjust to the canvas.

Of course the rendering is *automatic*.

## Animated 3D

The right side of the screen was done using the *Three.js* library.

It rotates around its axis.

*You can select texture for model*.

## Interactive 3D

This part of project also was done using the Three.js.

You can *zoom in* and *out* of the model, as well as *rotate it* around its axis.
